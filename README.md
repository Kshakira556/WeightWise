# WeightWise

**WeightWise** is a Python-based mobile application designed to help users track their weight progress over time. The app supports both manual and automated weight logging, visualizes data in easy-to-understand graphs, and provides weekly and overall analysis of weight changes. Alerts are generated when weight changes deviate significantly from a healthy range.

## Features

- **User Profile Management**: Create and manage user profiles securely.
- **Manual Weight Logging**: Input weekly weight logs manually in kilograms.
- **Automated Weight Logging**: Integrate with Xiaomi smart scales (or compatible devices) for automatic weight logging.
- **Data Visualization**: Graphical representation of weight logs to monitor progress.
- **Data Storage**: Store weight logs locally on your device.
- **Weekly and Overall Analysis**: Analyze weight changes and receive alerts if deviations exceed healthy thresholds.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Notify users when weight changes exceed or drop below specified thresholds.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Virtual environment (recommended).

### Setup

3. **Log Weight**:
   - Use the weight logging screen to manually enter your weight or connect to a smart scale for automatic logging.

4. **View Data**:
   - Access the graph screen to view visual representations of your weight data over time.

5. **Receive Alerts**:
   - Monitor alerts generated by the app if your weight changes significantly from week to week.

## Integration with Smart Scales
